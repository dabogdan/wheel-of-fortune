React Native Wheel of Fortune

Task: 

Create a component that accepts a parameter N â€“ a number indicating the number of sections in the circle.
Each section of the circle should be equal and clearly visible. It is advisable to use different colors or shades for each section.

Interaction:

Users should be able to "spin" the circle with their finger (on mobile) or mouse (on the web).
When initiating the circle's spin, it should continue to move for some time after the user releases it, emulating inertia.
The circle should provide tactile feedback upon interaction.
After the spinning ends, the program should determine and display which section stopped at the 12 o'clock mark.
Additional Notes:

The code should be well-structured, clean, and easily readable.
Adhere to best practices when developing in React Native and Typescript.
